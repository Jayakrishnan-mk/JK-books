There are two types of users - User and Admin.
The roles of Users are liking books, access product details, purchasing books ,etc. And I included a specific
feature for users. That is, if a customer want a book. But that book is not available in my sight . Then user can
request for that book. That is an additional feature in my web application. And users have coupons also for
buying books. They get discount through this coupon. Another one feature is , I added an OTP authentication for
login to users. So if a user want to login , then the user can choose to login with OTP or password.
The roles of Admin are - Admin have a dashboard. Where he can see the statistics like blocked user and
unblocked user, Payment ratio (COD payments and Online payments ratio), Total sales, orders, users and books,
etc. Admin can also block users where in which user wont be able to log in. Admin can also see the status of the
orders of users. The another main feature is admin can see the book requests from users if any book is not
available in our site. And admin can download the sales report , admin can add coupons , etc.
